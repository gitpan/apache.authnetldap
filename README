    module for user authentication for Apache

SYNOPSIS
     AuthName "LDAP Test Auth"
     AuthType Basic

     #only set the next two if you need to bind as a user for searching
     #PerlSetVar BindDN "uid=user1,ou=people,o=acme.com" #optional
     #PerlSetVar BindPWD "password" #optional
     PerlSetVar BaseDN "ou=people,o=acme.com"
     PerlSetVar LDAPServer ldap.acme.com
     PerlSetVar LDAPPort 389
     #PerlSetVar UIDAttr uid
     PerlSetVar UIDAttr mail

     require valid-user

     PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthNetLDAP

DESCRIPTION
    This module authenticates users via LDAP using the Net::LDAP
    module. This module is Graham Barr's "pure" Perl LDAP API.

    It also uses all of the same parameters as the
    Apache::AuthPerLDAP, but I have added two extra parameters.

    The parameters are:

    PerlSetVar BindDN
        Used to set initial LDAP user.

    PerlSetVar BindPWD
        Used to set initial LDAP password.

    PerlSetVar BaseDN
        This sets the search base used when looking up a user in an
        LDAP server.

    PerlSetVar LDAPServer
        This is the hostname of the LDAP server you wish to use.

    PerlSetVar LDAPPort
        This is the port the LDAP server is listening on.

    PerlSetVar UIDAttr
        The attribute used to lookup the user.

  Uses for UIDAttr

    For example if you set the UIDAttr to uid, then the LDAP search
    filter will lookup a user using the search filter:

    Normally you will use the uid attribute, but you may want (need)
    to use a different attribute depending on your LDAP server or to
    synchronize with different applications. For example some
    versions of Novell's LDAP servers that I've encountered stored
    the user's login name in the cn attribute (a really bad idea).
    And the Netscape Address Book uses a user's email address as the
    login id.

INSTALLATION
    It's a pretty straightforward install if you already have
    mod_perl and Net::LDAP already installed.

    After you have unpacked the distribution type:

    perl Makefile.PL make make install

    Then in your httpd.conf file or .htaccess file, in either a
    <Directory> or <Location> section put:

     AuthName "LDAP Test Auth"
     AuthType Basic

     #only set the next two if you need to bind as a user for searching
     #PerlSetVar BindDN "uid=user1,ou=people,o=acme.com" #optional
     #PerlSetVar BindPWD "password" #optional
     PerlSetVar BaseDN "ou=people,o=acme.com"
     PerlSetVar LDAPServer ldap.acme.com
     PerlSetVar LDAPPort 389
     PerlSetVar UIDAttr uid 

     require valid-user

     PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthNetLDAP
